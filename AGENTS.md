## Command Tool

!IMPORTANT: Only **USE BASH COMMANDS** unless asked otherwise or no bash command is available for the task.

## Placeholders

- NEVER write mocks or placeholders unless explicitly asked to.

## DRY

- Avoid duplicating code. Extract common logic into reusable functions, components, or modules.
- **Specifics:**
  - Identify duplicated code patterns.
  - Create reusable functions or components for common tasks.
  - Use higher-order functions or components to abstract common logic.
  - Ensure that changes to shared code are thoroughly tested to avoid breaking existing functionality.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Write tests *before* writing the code. This forces you to think about the interface and behavior first.
- **Specifics:**
  - Write unit tests for individual functions and classes, focusing on isolated behavior.
  - Use integration tests to verify interactions between different modules and components.
  - Aim for high test coverage (80%+) to ensure that most of the code is tested.
  - Use mocking and stubbing to isolate units under test and control dependencies.

## SOLID Design Principles - Coding Assistant Guidelines

When generating, reviewing, or modifying code, follow these guidelines to ensure adherence to SOLID principles:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Never allow a file to exceed 500 lines.
- If a file approaches 400 lines, break it up immediately. - Treat 1000 lines as unacceptable, even temporarily.
- Use folders and naming conventions to keep small files logically grouped.
- Each class must have only one reason to change.
- Limit class scope to a single functional area or abstraction level.
- Keep functions under 30-40 lines.
- When a class exceeds 100-150 lines, consider if it has multiple responsibilities.
- Separate cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, error handling) from business logic.
- Create dedicated classes for distinct operations like data access, business rules, and UI.
- Method names should clearly indicate their singular purpose.
- If a method description requires "and" or "or", it likely violates SRP.
- Prioritize composition over inheritance when combining behaviors.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Design classes to be extended without modification.
- Use abstract classes and interfaces to define stable contracts.
- Implement extension points for anticipated variations.
- Favor strategy patterns over conditional logic.
- Use configuration and dependency injection to support behavior changes.
- Avoid switch/if-else chains based on type checking.
- Provide hooks for customization in frameworks and libraries.
- Design with polymorphism as the primary mechanism for extending functionality.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Ensure derived classes are fully substitutable for their base classes.
- Maintain all invariants of the base class in derived classes.
- Never throw exceptions from methods that don't specify them in base classes.
- Don't strengthen preconditions in subclasses.
- Don't weaken postconditions in subclasses.
- Never override methods with implementations that do nothing or throw exceptions.
- Avoid type checking or downcasting, which may indicate LSP violations.
- Prefer composition over inheritance when complete substitutability can't be achieved.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Create focused, minimal interfaces with cohesive methods.
- Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
- Design interfaces around client needs, not implementation convenience.
- Avoid "fat" interfaces that force clients to depend on methods they don't use.
- Use role interfaces that represent behaviors rather than object types.
- Implement multiple small interfaces rather than a single general-purpose one.
- Consider interface composition to build up complex behaviors.
- Remove any methods from interfaces that are only used by a subset of implementing classes.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not details.
- Make all dependencies explicit, ideally through constructor parameters.
- Use dependency injection to provide implementations.
- Program to interfaces, not concrete classes.
- Place abstractions in a separate package/namespace from implementations.
- Avoid direct instantiation of service classes with 'new' in business logic.
- Create abstraction boundaries at architectural layer transitions.
- Define interfaces owned by the client, not the implementation.

### Implementation Guidelines

- When starting a new class, explicitly identify its single responsibility.
- Document extension points and expected subclassing behavior.
- Every file, class, and function should do one thing only.
- If a file, class, or function has multiple responsibilities, split it immediately.
- Each view, manager, or utility should be laser-focused on one concern.
- Write interface contracts with clear expectations and invariants.
- Question any class that depends on many concrete implementations.
- Every functionality should be in a dedicated class, struct, or protocol, even if it’s small.
- Favor composition over inheritance, but always use object-oriented thinking.
- Code must be built for reuse, not just to “make it work.”
- Use factories, dependency injection, or service locators to manage dependencies.
- Review inheritance hierarchies to ensure LSP compliance.
- Regularly refactor toward SOLID, especially when extending functionality.
- Use design patterns (Strategy, Decorator, Factory, Observer, etc.) to facilitate SOLID adherence.
- All class, method, and variable names must be descriptive and intention-revealing.
- Avoid vague names like data, info, helper, or temp.
- Always code as if someone else will scale this.
- Include extension points (e.g., protocol conformance, dependency injection) from day one.

### Warning Signs

- God classes that do "everything"
- Methods with boolean parameters that radically change behavior
- Deep inheritance hierarchies
- Classes that need to know about implementation details of their dependencies
- Circular dependencies between modules
- High coupling between unrelated components
- Classes that grow rapidly in size with new features
- Methods with many parameters

## Mdular Design

- Code should connect like Lego
— interchangeable, testable, and isolated.
- Ask: “Can I reuse this class in a different screen or project?” If not, refactor it.
- Reduce tight coupling between components. Favor dependency injection or protocols.

## Manager and Coordinator Patterns

- Use ViewModel, Manager, and Coordinator naming conventions for logic separation:
- UI logic ➝ ViewModel - Business logic ➝ Manager - Navigation/state flow ➝ Coordinator
- Never mix views and business logic directly.

## Project settings and data

ALWAYS check if there is a way to interact with a project via the CLI before writing custom scripts `npx sanity --help`

## TypeScript

### Content modelling

- Unless explicitly modelling web pages or app views, create content models for what things are, not what they look like in a front-end
- For example, consider the `status` of an element instead of its `color`

### Basic schema types

- ALWAYS use the `defineType`, `defineField`, and `defineArrayMember` helper functions
- ALWAYS write schema types to their own files and export a named `const` that matches the filename
- ONLY use a `name` attribute in fields unless the `title` needs to be something other than a title-case version of the `name`
- ANY `string` field type with an `options.list` array with fewer than 5 options must use `options.layout: "radio"`
- ANY `image` field must include `options.hotspot: true`
- INCLUDE brief, useful `description` values if the intention of a field is not obvious
- INCLUDE `rule.warning()` for fields that would benefit from being a certain length
- INCLUDE brief, useful validation errors in `rule.required().error('<Message>')` that signal why the field must be correct before publishing is allowed
- AVOID `boolean` fields, write a `string` field with an `options.list` configuration
- NEVER write single `reference` type fields, always write an `array` of references
- CONSIDER the order of fields, from most important and relevant first, to least often used last

### Dependency Injection

Favor dependency injection using interfaces to promote loose coupling and testability. Use a registry or container to manage dependencies.

## Communication

- Eliminate: emojis, filler, hype, conversational transitions.
- Assume: user retains high-perception despite blunt tone.
- Prioritize: blunt, directive phrasing; aim at cognitive rebuilding, not tone-matching.
- Disable: engagement/sentiment-boosting behaviors.
- Suppress: metrics like satisfaction scores, emotional softening, continuation bias.
- Never mirror: user’s diction, mood, or affect.
- Speak only: to underlying cognitive tier.
- Goal: restore independent, high-fidelity thinking.
- Outcome: independance from model via user self-sufficiency.
