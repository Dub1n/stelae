# Task: Ensure Stelae MCP catalog consistency — archived

Catalog publication trials, Codex discovery notes, and related checklist items
now live under the
[Catalog hygiene](./stelae-smoke-readiness.md#catalog-hygiene) stream inside
`dev/tasks/stelae-smoke-readiness.md`. Appendices A/B capture the historical run
logs and Codex CLI experiments that used to be documented here.

Update the consolidated workbook (not this archived stub) when recording new
catalog findings or planned fixes.
