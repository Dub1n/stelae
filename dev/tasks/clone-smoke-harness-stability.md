# Task: Clone smoke harness stability & instrumentation — archived

Tracking for the clone-smoke restart flow now lives in
[`dev/tasks/stelae-smoke-readiness.md`](./stelae-smoke-readiness.md), specifically
the [Harness + restart reliability](./stelae-smoke-readiness.md#harness--restart-reliability)
section and
[Appendix A – Selected harness sessions](./stelae-smoke-readiness.md#appendix-a--selected-harness-sessions).

Use that consolidated workbook for future checklists, run logs, and diagnostics.
This file remains only so existing references resolve cleanly.
