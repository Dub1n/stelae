# Task: Stelae tool aggregation visibility & schema dedupe — archived

Active catalog hygiene tracking (dedupe status, harness regression expectations,
and follow-up trials) moved to the
[Catalog hygiene](./stelae-smoke-readiness.md#catalog-hygiene) section of
`dev/tasks/stelae-smoke-readiness.md`. Historical regression tests and schema
notes now live there so we have one source of truth for catalog work.

Please record any future aggregation or manifest updates in the consolidated
workbook rather than this archived file.
