# Codex CLI smoke test – `manage_stelae` — archived

The Codex orchestration plan, prerequisites, golden-path payloads, and run logs
are now tracked in
[`dev/tasks/stelae-smoke-readiness.md`](./stelae-smoke-readiness.md), primarily
under the [Codex orchestration](./stelae-smoke-readiness.md#codex-orchestration)
section and [Appendix B](./stelae-smoke-readiness.md#appendix-b--codex-cli-smoke-manage_stelae).

Keep using the consolidated workbook for future MCP smoke experiments so this
initiative has a single source of truth.
