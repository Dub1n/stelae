# Stelae MCP Tool Invocation Log - 2025-11-14

- Session opened against `http://127.0.0.1:9090/mcp` and every tool from the current `tools/list` payload was invoked via `tools/call`, per the AGENTS.md directive to rely on real MCP responses.
- Commands were issued with a small Python harness that reuses `dev/debug/chatgpt_connector_probe.py`; the raw "curl-style" transcript (full JSON for each HTTP request/response) lives at `dev/logs/tool_invocations/20251114T104345Z-tool-calls.json`.
- Each tool was also invoked through the MCP bridge (`mcp__stelae__*` adapters) so we can capture what Codex sees when it calls the tool directly; those outputs are summarized below and can be reproduced by reusing the same adapters.
- The table now compares both perspectives so we can spot gaps (double-encoding, schema validation errors, discovery drift, etc.) without rerunning the probes.

| Tool | Operation / arguments | curl response highlight | Direct MCP response highlight | Expected response | Required fixes | Notes | Tester's response highlight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `doc_fetch_suite` | `{"operation": "list_documentation_sources_tool"}` | Still returns a JSON blob encoded inside `structuredContent.result`; the inner payload reads `Available documentation sources:\n[]` even after the README + ARCHITECTURE sources were added. | Direct call against the underlying `list_documentation_sources_tool` reports the same plain-text message (`Available documentation sources:\n[]`). | Should enumerate the two seeded Docy sources (`stelae-readme`, `stelae-architecture`) without the extra JSON-in-a-string layer. | Diagnose why Docy’s list endpoint ignores `.docy.urls` (likely needs a cache refresh) and teach the aggregate to surface structured objects instead of serialized strings. | Catalog now contains two entries, but Docy hasn’t ingested them, so both viewpoints still show an empty list. |  |
| `grep` | `{"pattern": "Stelae", "paths": ["README.md"], "recursive": false, "max_count": 5}` | Structured content reports `No matches found`. | Direct call returns `{"content":[{"text":"No matches found"}],"isError":false}`. | Should stream ripgrep hits (or an empty set) from `${STELAE_DIR}` per the stack snapshot (README.md:12-13). |  | Rg wrapper is reachable in both flows; nested result format persists. |  |
| `manage_docy_sources` | `{"operation": "list_sources"}` | Still double-encodes the JSON blob, but the inner object now lists the two seeded sources plus the catalog + `.docy.urls` paths. | CLI invocation via `/home/gabri/.venvs/stelae-bridge/bin/python scripts/docy_manager_server.py --cli --operation list_sources` returns the proper JSON object (two sources, catalog path, URL file). | Should deliver the same object to both clients so Codex no longer hits validation errors. | Remove the extra serialization layer in the proxy so `structuredContent.result` is already an object. | Data is present and correct; only the transport wrapper still needs cleanup. |  |
| `manage_stelae` | `{"operation": "list_discovered_servers"}` | `status: "ok"` with an empty `servers` list; points at `/home/gabri/.config/stelae/discovered_servers.local.json`. | CLI (`.../scripts/stelae_integrator_server.py --cli --operation list_discovered_servers`) reports the same empty cache. | Should list cached descriptors with the standard `status/details/files_updated/commands_run` envelope (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:298-305). | Refresh the discovery cache (or run a new discovery pass) before logging so both views capture the populated overlay. | No drift this time—both paths agree the cache is empty, so the next run needs a discover/install stage first. |  |
| `memory_suite` | `{"operation": "list_memory_projects"}` | Text lists `main` and `stelae (current, default)`. | Direct call echoes the same two-project list + HTML comment. | Should enumerate Basic Memory projects and mark the current/default workspace (README.md:139). |  | Confirms Basic Memory health in both pathways. |  |
| `scrapling_fetch_suite` | `{"operation": "s_fetch_page", "url": "https://example.com", "mode": "basic", "format": "markdown", "max_length": 2000}` | Metadata block with `total_length`/`retrieved_length` followed by Example Domain markdown. | Direct adapter returns the same metadata + body payload. | Expected to return `{metadata, content}` as described in the Scrapling schema note (README.md:49,141). |  | Demonstrates successful outbound fetch with no truncation. |  |
| `strata_ops_suite` | `{"operation": "discover_server_actions", "user_query": "status endpoints", "server_names": []}` | Structured result is `{"servers":{}}`. | Direct call returns the same empty `{"servers":{}}` blob. | When supplied with concrete `server_names`, should enumerate available actions (README.md:142; config/bundles/starter_bundle.json). | Provide real `server_names` during smoke runs so this suite exercises action discovery instead of returning `{}`. | Need populated `server_names` to exercise richer paths. |  |
| `workspace_fs_read` | `{"operation": "read_file", "path": "README.md"}` | Echoed the entire `~/apps/mcp-proxy/README.md`. | Direct call returns the same MCP proxy README payload. | Filesystem MCP is documented as `--root ${STELAE_DIR}` (README.md:12), so reads should land in this repo rather than the proxy checkout. | Point the filesystem server at `${STELAE_DIR}` before the next audit to keep smoke runs focused on this workspace. | The filesystem server currently targets the proxy repo rather than this project. |  |
| `workspace_fs_write` | `{"operation": "create_directory", "path": "/home/gabri/dev/stelae/dev/tmp/workspace-fs-write-test"}` | `"Service is running in read-only mode..."` | Direct adapter returns the same read-only warning string. | Aggregation describes mutating helpers that should succeed when the server runs with write permissions (README.md:136-138). | Start the filesystem server with write permissions (e.g., `--allow-write`) when destructive operations are required. | Write surface disabled until the fs server restarts with `--allow-write`. |  |
| `workspace_shell_control` | `{"operation": "get_current_directory"}` | Structured result `/home/gabri/apps/mcp-proxy`. | Direct call returns `/home/gabri/apps/mcp-proxy`. | Shell MCP launches with `--workdir {{PHOENIX_ROOT}}` (config/bundles/starter_bundle.json:90-99), so the reported cwd should match that workspace. | Update `PHOENIX_ROOT` (or change directories after launch) so shell ops execute inside the intended repo. | Shell controller is live and currently scoped to the proxy workspace. |  |

These snapshots should make it easy to compare future clone-smoke results (e.g., verifying the Docy wrapper still double-encodes or checking whether `workspace_fs_read` ever points back at the Stelae repo). Use the companion log file whenever a full JSON diff is needed for troubleshooting.
