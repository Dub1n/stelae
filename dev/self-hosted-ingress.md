No ready-made kit does that for you. A turnkey “self-hosted ingress” stack would need to bundle: dynamic DNS, router/NAT control, TLS issuance, a reverse proxy, and service supervision—essentially a personal edge gateway. I couldn’t locate any project that packages all of that specifically for MCP or even generic home ingress in one installer; you always end up assembling pieces:

Dynamic DNS: ddclient, acme.sh DNS hooks, or router-integrated DDNS.
TLS: Caddy, Traefik, nginx + certbot.
Reverse proxy: same tools as above pointing at WSL.
Service management: systemd/pm2.
Port forwarding: still manual unless your router supports UPnP/IGD scripts.
Even large homelab solutions (OpenWrt, pfSense, Nginx Proxy Manager, Traefik’s Docker stacks) require configuring each component. There’s no “one binary” or simple package manager entry that does everything for you while staying self-hosted. If you want the most integrated option today, something like Caddy or Traefik gets you TLS + reverse proxy with minimal config, but you still handle DNS and forwarding yourself.

Figure roughly 2–4 focused hours if you already have the pieces installed. Breakdown:

Prep/Install (15–30 min)

Install Caddy or Traefik on Windows (or inside WSL if you’ll forward ports externally).
Ensure WSL ↔ Windows loopback works (localhost:9090 reachable from Windows).
DNS and Port Forwarding (30–60 min)

Assign or register a domain/subdomain, update DNS to your public IP (or set up DDNS if it changes).
Configure router to forward TCP/443 → Windows host; open Windows firewall for that port.
TLS + Reverse Proxy Config (45–60 min)

Caddyfile or Traefik config that listens on yourdomain:443, proxies to http://localhost:9090, handles / to /stream, and exposes /.well-known/mcp/manifest.json.
Let’s Encrypt certificate issuance/renewal verified.
Testing & Integration (30–45 min)

Test local (Windows) and external access to manifest and stream endpoints.
Update ChatGPT connector to the new HTTPS URL.
Add service supervision (systemd, NSSM, or Task Scheduler) so the proxy starts with Windows.
Hardening & Cleanup (optional 30 min)

Logging, rate limits, health checks.
Document the steps for future maintenance.
If you hit issues—dynamic DNS quirks, router firmware that resists forwarding, TLS errors—add another hour. Caddy tends to be the quickest because it auto-handles TLS and simple reverse-proxy syntax; Traefik adds flexibility but costs more setup time.
