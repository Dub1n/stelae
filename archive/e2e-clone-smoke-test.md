# Task: E2E clone smoke test (Codex MCP harness) — archived

This task record has been consolidated into
[`dev/tasks/stelae-smoke-readiness.md`](../dev/tasks/stelae-smoke-readiness.md), which now
covers catalog hygiene, harness/restart reliability, and Codex orchestration in one place. See
[Appendix C – Clone smoke harness deliverable snapshot](../dev/tasks/stelae-smoke-readiness.md#appendix-c--clone-smoke-harness-deliverable-snapshot)
for the original checklist, CLI flags, and automation outcomes.

Please update `stelae-smoke-readiness.md` (rather than this file) when adding new
notes or action items for the clone smoke initiative.
