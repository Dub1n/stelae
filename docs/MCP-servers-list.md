# mcp servers for local dev (windows + wsl, vscodium)

*scope*: local coding on your machine (windows + wsl + vscodium). prefer no sign‑ups / no vendor lock‑in / no cloud runtimes. allow GitHub access as the only remote. be generous if a tool adds value to generic dev flows (fs, git, testing, security) and can run locally.

## Notes

- if you want a sandboxed shell: pair Filesystem MCP with an allow-listed command tool run under a non-privileged WSL user; avoid raw bash -c.
- for browser testing, you now have three flavors listed (Puppeteer, Playwright+Docker, Playwright screenshots). pick one stack to reduce overhead
- test with MCP Discovery.

- safety defaults:
  - add a minimal “command exec” tool (stdin/stdout only, allowlist of commands like npm run, pytest, ruff, pytest -k, make, git status), sandboxed via WSL non‑privileged user.
  - directory allowlist: single project root; reject .. paths.
  - read‑only by default; require confirmation for write/delete.
  - no raw shell: expose task‑shaped tools, not bash -c.
  - log everything to a dedicated file per session.
